## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I will create a Ministry Tracking application for my church. The tracker will allow ministry leaders to manage its members, events, meetings, and a to do list. Leaders will have convenient access to member information including contact information. It will allow ministry events and meetings as well as leadership meetings to be viewed in a calendar. To do lists will provide leaders with a way to manage ministry goals. The pastor will have a place to have general, summary information for each ministry all in one place. 
### Features
User signup and  Login -  Each ministry leader will be able to create an account under their ministry. Upon login, the leader can only view their ministry. The pastor will have a different access once logged in. 

API Integration -  Each ministry page will include a calendar API integration for event and meetings. 

To Do Lists - Each ministry page will allow the ministry to add To Do list items on their own page.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to authenticate and authorize the correct users, so only leaders and the pastor are allowed to register and access the application. Once logged in, the leader should only have access to their own page. The pastor should only have a summary of information.
